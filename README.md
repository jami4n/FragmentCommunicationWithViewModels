Fragment to Fragment Communication With ViewModels

A short project on how to enable fragment to fragment / fragment to activity communication using view models and livedata.
This strays from the traditional way of using interfaces for achieving the same task.

Using View Models is a much better approach as it facilitates code reduction and helps maintain a better project architecture.
Also pushing an update to one Viewmodel will update data in all livedata observables in other fragments without writing extra code.
